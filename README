The instructions below detail how to install tsucheckers: https://github.com/mikehengineer/tsuchecker.git on three virtual machines with Centos7 operating systems.

Technologies used: Laravel, Virtualbox, Vagrant and Ansible

The application was developed with Laravel/PHP 7.2 and is fairly straightforward.  The website will accept a POST request from the user who is exepcted to supply a JSON encoded 8x8 two dimensional array.  The application reads in the JSON array and on each square it searches in 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) for four red or black squares in a row.  If four in a row are found, the starting coordinates, color and direction are added to an array that is returned to the user in JSON.

Sample input:
[
  ["R","R","B","-","B","B","B","-"],
  ["B","R","B","B","B","B","-","-"],
  ["B","R","B","B","R","R","-","B"],
  ["R","R","R","-","-","R","R","R"],
  ["B","B","B","R","-","-","-","B"],
  ["-","R","B","B","B","B","-","B"],
  ["R","B","-","B","R","B","-","R"],
  ["B","R","-","R","B","-","-","-"]
]

Locally, in each virtual machine, the application can be found in /var/www/html/checkers

Most of the interesting code is in App/Http/Controllers/CheckersController.php

Additionally, Vagrant is used to instantiate three virtualboxes and runs an Ansible playbook that automates all of the installation and configuration work.

--Instructions--

Install Virtualbox:
sudo apt-get install virtualbox

Install Vagrant:
sudo apt-get install vagrant

Install Ansible:
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible

In a directory of your choice:
1. Initialize Vagrant
   vagrant init

2. Replace default Vagrantfile with the supplied Vagrantfile.

3. Verify that checkers.yml is in the same folder as Vagrant and the Vagrantfile.

4. Inside the /etc/ansible directory:
   Add the "files" and "scripts" folders supplied.

5. Navigate back to the directory with the Vagrant install.

6. Intialize and provision the virtual machines.
   sudo vagrant up --provision

The setup will take several minutes.

Each virtual machine can be reached at:
machine1 - 192.168.10.10
machine2 - 192.168.20.20
machine3 - 192.168.30.30

If you would like to connect to any of the servers:
sudo vagrant ssh machine1
sudo vagrant ssh machine2
sudo vagrant ssh machine3
