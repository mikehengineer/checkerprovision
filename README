Install virtualbox:

Create directory and navigate to it
sudo mkdir TSU
cd TSU

Initialize vagrant

replace Vagrantfile

add install_composer.sh
add install_checkers.sh

navigate back to ~/TSU
sudo vagrant up --provision

Vagrant will initialize three servers and run the ansible playbook (checkers.yml) against them.

The three server local addresses are: 192.168.20.20, 192.168.30.30, 192.168.40.40

As of right now I'm having a problem getting apache to play nice with laravel's file permission needs.

Once complete there will be a fourth file, /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, that ansible will replace that will hold the virtual host for the server.  At the moment only Apache's splash page will show.

The application itself is pretty straightforward.  I used a MVC structure to create a restful API where a person can send a POST request with a 8x8 JSON checkerboard and a JSON array holding all of the four in a row combinations will be returned.

The algorithm itself is straightforward.  It checks every square in all eight directions for four in a row.  Once found it is added to the output array.
